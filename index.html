        Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread
        dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato,
        olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked
        quickly‚Äîusually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated
        to a very high temperature‚Äîand served hot. One of the simplest and most
        traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or
        tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was
        named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have
        liked its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping
        colours‚Äîgreen, white, and red‚Äîwere those of the Italian flag.

        <h3>Boston Pizza</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Boston Pizza began in Edmonton, Alberta, on August 12, 1964, when four
          Greek immigrants, Trifon, Gus, Perry, and Ninos Agioritis opened
          Boston Pizza and Spaghetti House. By 1970, Boston Pizza had 17
          locations in Western Canada, 15 of which were franchised. One of the
          first franchisees was Jim Treliving, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police
          officer who lived down the street from the original location and was a
          regular customer. In 1968, he noticed the growing popularity of Boston
          Pizza and purchased the rights to open a restaurant in Penticton,
          British Columbia. While in Penticton, he met George Melville, a
          chartered accountant. He acted as Treliving's business consultant for
          four years, and, in 1973, became Treliving's business partner. Over 10
          years, they opened 16 restaurants in British Columbia.

      <h2 id="historyOfPizza">The history of Pizza</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
      The history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures
      produced basic flatbreads with several toppings. A precursor of pizza was
      probably the focaccia, a flatbread known to the Romans as panis focacius,
      to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar
      flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. The
      word pizza was first documented in 997 AD in Gaeta and successively in
      different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in
      Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when
      Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other
      Italian foods.
    </p>

    <h3>Origins</h3>

    <p class="paragraph">
      In Sardinia, French and Italian archaeologists have found bread baked over
      7,000 years ago. According to Philippe Marinval, the local islanders
      leavened this bread.[4] Foods similar to pizza have been made since
      antiquity. Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it
      more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history.

      <li class="li">
        In the 6th century BC, Persian soldiers serving under Darius the Great
        baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields.
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        In Ancient Greece, citizens made a flat bread called plakous (œÄŒªŒ±Œ∫Œø·ø¶œÇ,
        gen. œÄŒªŒ±Œ∫Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒøœÇ ‚Äì plakountos) which was flavored with toppings like
        herbs, onion, cheese and garlic.
      </li>
      <li class="li">
        An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid (c. 19 BC),
        when Celaeno, the Harpy queen, foretells that the Trojans would not find
        peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In
        Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes
        (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the
        bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.
      </li>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Some commentators have suggested that the origins of modern pizza can be
      traced to pizzarelle, which were kosher for Passover cookies eaten by
      Roman Jews after returning from the synagogue on that holiday, though some
      also trace its origins to other Italian paschal breads. Abba Eban writes
      "some scholars think [pizza] was first made more than 2,000 years ago when
      Roman soldiers added cheese and olive oil to matzah". Other examples of
      flatbreads that survive to this day from the ancient Mediterranean world
      are focaccia (which may date back as far as the ancient Etruscans);
      Manakish in Levant, coca (which has sweet and savory varieties) from
      Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands; the Greek Pita; Lepinja in
      the Balkans; or Piadina in the Romagna part of Emilia-Romagna in Italy.
      Foods similar to flatbreads in other parts of the world include Chinese
      bing (a wheat flour-based Chinese food with a flattened or disk-like
      shape); the Indian paratha (in which fat is incorporated); the Central and
      South Asian naan (leavened) and roti (unleavened); the Sardinian carasau,
      spianata, guttiau, pistoccu; and Finnish rieska. Also worth noting is that
      throughout Europe there are many similar pies based on the idea of
      covering flat pastry with cheese, meat, vegetables and seasoning such as
      the Alsatian flammkuchen, German zwiebelkuchen, and French quiche. In
      16th-century Naples, a galette flatbread was referred to as a pizza. Known
      as the dish for poor people, it was sold in the street and was not
      considered a kitchen recipe for a long time. Nonetheless, it was not until
      the Spanish brought the tomato from the Americas and developed the modern
      variation that Pizzas in their modern conception were invented. It is said
      that the tomato reached the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily, at the time part
      of the Spanish Empire, through either Pedro √Ålvarez de Toledo in the 16th
      century or viceroy Manuel de Amat, who may have gifted some seeds to the
      Neapolitans in 1770 on behalf of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In 1843,
      Alexandre Dumas described the diversity of pizza toppings. An often
      recounted story holds that on June 11, 1889, to honour the queen consort
      of Italy, Margherita of Savoy, the Neapolitan pizza maker Raffaele
      Esposito created the "Pizza Margherita", a pizza garnished with tomatoes,
      mozzarella, and basil, to represent the national colours of Italy as on
      the Flag of Italy. But the Pizza Margherita already existed: "The most
      popular and famous pizzas from Naples were the Marinara, created in 1734,
      and the Margherita, which dates from 1796-1810. The latter was presented
      to the Queen of Italy upon her visit to Naples in 1889, specifically on
      account of the colour of its seasoning (tomato, mozzarella and basil)
      which are reminiscent of the colours of the Italian flag." Pizza
      evolved into a type of bread and tomato dish, often served with cheese.
      However, until the late 19th or early 20th century, the dish was sweet,
      not savory, and earlier versions which were savory more resembled the flat
      breads now known as schiacciata. Pellegrino Artusi's classic
      early-twentieth-century cookbook, La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar
      bene gives three recipes for pizza, all of which are sweet. After the
      feedback of some readers, Artusi added a typed sheet in the 1911 edition
      (discovered by food historian Alberto Capatti), bound with the volume,
      with the recipe of "pizza alla napoletana": mozzarella, tomatoes,
      anchovies and mushrooms. However, by 1927, Ada Boni's first edition of il
      talismano della felicit√† (a well-known Italian cookbook) includes a recipe
      using tomatoes and mozzarella.
    </p>

    <h3>Innovation</h3>

    <p class="paragraph">
      The innovation that led to flatbread pizza was the use of tomato as a
      topping. For some time after the tomato was brought to Europe from the
      Americas in the 16th century, it was believed by many Europeans to be
      poisonous, like some other fruits of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family
      are. However, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the
      area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based flatbread, and so
      the pizza began. The dish gained popularity, and soon pizza became a
      tourist attraction as visitors to Naples ventured into the poorer areas of
      the city to try the local specialty.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      According to documents discovered by historian Antonio Mattozzi in State
      Archive of Naples, in 1807 already 54 pizzerias existed, with their owners
      and addresses. In the second half of the nineteenth century they increased
      to 120. In Naples, two other figures connected to the trade existed ‚Äì the
      pizza hawker (pizzaiuolo ambulante), who sold pizza, but did not make it,
      and the seller of pizza "a oggi a otto", who made pizzas, but sold them in
      return for a payment for seven days. The pizza marinara method has a
      topping of tomato, oregano, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. It is
      named "marinara" because it was traditionally the food prepared by "la
      marinara", the seaman's wife, for her seafaring husband when he returned
      from fishing trips in the Bay of Naples. The margherita is topped with
      modest amounts of tomato sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil. It is widely
      attributed to baker Raffaele Esposito, who worked at the restaurant
      "Pietro... e basta cos√¨" ("Pietro... and that's enough"), established in
      1880 and still in business as "Pizzeria Brandi". Though recent research
      casts doubt on this legend, the tale holds that, in 1889, he baked three
      different pizzas for the visit of King Umberto I and Queen Margherita of
      Savoy. The Queen's favorite was a pizza evoking the colors of the Italian
      flag ‚Äì green (basil leaves), white (mozzarella), and red (tomatoes).
      According to the tale, this combination was named Pizza Margherita in her
      honor. Although those were the most preferred, today there are many
      variations of pizzas. "Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana" ("True
      Neapolitan Pizza Association"), which was founded in 1984, has set the
      very specific rules that must be followed for an authentic Neapolitan
      pizza. These include that the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed
      oven; that the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin
      or prepared by any mechanical means (i pizzaioli ‚Äì the pizza makers ‚Äì make
      the pizza by rolling it with their fingers) and that the pizza must not
      exceed 35 centimetres in diameter or be more than one-third of a
      centimetre thick at the centre. The association also selects pizzerias all
      around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana
      philosophy and method.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      There are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas
      can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo,
      Trianon, and Umberto. Most of them are in the ancient historical center of
      Naples. These pizzerias follow even stricter standards than the specified
      rules by, for example, using only San Marzano tomatoes grown on the slopes
      of Mount Vesuvius and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in
      only a clockwise direction. The pizza bases in Naples are soft and
      pliable. In Rome, they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form
      of pizza in Italy is "pizza al taglio", which is pizza baked in
      rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight. In
      1962, the "Hawaiian" pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was
      invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulos at the Satellite
      Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario. In December 2009, the pizza napoletana was
      granted Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status by the European
      Union. In 2012, the world's largest pizza was made in Rome and it was
      measured to be 1261.65 square meters in area. In 2016, robotics company
      BeeHex, widely covered in the media, was building robots that 3D-printed
      pizza. In December 2017, the pizza napoletana was inscribed on the UNESCO
      Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

    <h3>Pizza In Canada</h3>

    <p class="paragraph">
      Canada's first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in Montreal.
      Starting in the late 1950s, the first pizza ovens started entering the
      country. It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias
      and restaurants opening across the country. Pizza was mostly served in
      restaurants and small pizzerias. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also
      serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad,
      soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side
      options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza,
      including chicken wings, fries and poutine, salad, and calzones. Pizza
      Pops are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza
      chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and
      neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a
      sit-and-dine facility for customers. The most distinct pizza in Canada is
      the "Canadian" pizza. A "Canadian" pizza is usually prepared with tomato
      sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bacon. Many variations
      of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza
      distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost
      never served with "Canadian bacon", or back bacon as it's referred to in
      Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph">
      In the province of Quebec Pizza-ghetti is a combination meal commonly
      found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced
      in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based
      sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian
      cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A
      popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the
      pizza's mozzarella cheese Some of Canada's successful pizza brands
      include: Boston Pizza and Pizza Pizza. Boston Pizza, also known as BP's in
      Canada, and "Boston's ‚Äì the Gourmet Pizza" in the United States and
      Mexico, is one of Canada's largest franchising restaurants. The brand has
      opened over 325 locations across Canada and 50 locations in Mexico and the
      US. The first Boston Pizza location was opened in Edmonton, Alberta, in
      1964, and operated under the name "Boston Pizza & Spaghetti House", with
      locations still opening across the nation. Pizza Pizza, and its subsidiary
      chain Pizza 73 in Western Canada, are among Canada's largest domestic
      brands based in Ontario.[citation needed] To date, they have over 500
      locations nationwide, and fill more than 29 million orders annually. With
      pizza gaining popularity across the nation, major American pizza chains
      such as Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza and Little Caesars have expanded their
      locations in Canada, competing against the domestic Canadian brands. The
      major American pizza chains have brought their signature classic pizza
      recipes and toppings into their Canadian chains, offering their
      traditional classic pizzas to Canadian customers. However, the American
      chains have also created Canadian specialty pizzas that are available only
      in Canada.
