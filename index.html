    <h1>Santillo Italian's Pizza</h1>

    <p>
      pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread
      dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives,
      mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked
      quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated
      to a very high temperature—and served hot. One of the simplest and most
      traditional pizzas is the Margherita, which is topped with tomatoes or
      tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. Popular legend relates that it was
      named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked
      its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping
      colours—green, white, and red—were those of the Italian flag.
