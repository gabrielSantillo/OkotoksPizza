This assigment will follow this steps: 

Using the projectStarter script from unit one or the mkdir command, create a new folder called "OkotoksPizza" (use your Assignments folder for this one, not Projects). 
Follow the GitHub / Local Git workflow to start a GitHub and local repository for your project
Edit the index.html file to contain:
One title for the page (use the appropriate text tag) 
One paragraph about pizza (this can be taken from any website or made up)
A few images of of things like a pizza chef, ingredients, or a pizza store
BONUS: Add some style to the images and text using the style.css file created. This will require you to connect to the CSS file and to read ahead on CSS, but it is very doable if you have the time.

Use regular hyperlinks to:
Add 2 internal links to your page.
This means you need to create 2 new html files inside your project folder. These don't need to have any special content, but do need to:
link back to index.html 
contain a header / title
An external link to Yelp/Google Reviews (for a comparable business like pizza hut or an actual local pizza shop)
Email hyperlink to: info@okotokspizza.ca
Phone hyperlink to: (403) 555-5555
BONUS

Anchor Links:
Add 3 anchor tags
